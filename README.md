# EG2310 Fundamentals of Systems Design: TurtleBot Project Group 12, Year 2 Academic Year 2021-2022, Semester 2, National University of Singapore

My team and I have designed an autonomous TurtleBot as part of the Fundamentals of System Design course, which introduces freshmen to the principles of systems design involving mechanical, electrical, and software elements. Through hands-on exercises and homework assignments, we developed expertise in mechanical design, electrical hardware, and middleware software frameworks. Our project focused on integrating these subsystems to create a mobile robot capable of autonomous navigation, obstacle detection, and identifying NFC tags and infrared signatures. For our semester challenge, we designed and implemented a targeting mechanism to fire ping pong balls at a heated tin can.
